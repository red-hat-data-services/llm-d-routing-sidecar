# Testing

## Testing the NIXLConnector


The [nixl](config/overlays/fmass/nixl) directory contains the configuration files deploying
a simple 1P1D sample application using the NIXL connector.

To deploy this application in the `eval` cluster, run this command:

```
$ kustomize build test/config/overlays/fmass/nixl | oc apply -f -
```

Wait a bit (up to 10mn) for the pods to be running.

### Sending a request to the decode sidecar

Port-forward the decode sidecar port on your local machine:

```
$ oc port-forward pod/qwen-decoder 8000:8000
```

Send a request:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-prefiller-url: http://qwen-prefiller:8000" \
      -d '{"model": "Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B", "prompt": "Question: Greta worked 40 hours and was paid $12 per hour. Her friend Lisa earned $15 per hour at her job. How many hours would Lisa have to work to equal Gretas earnings for 40 hours?", "max_tokens": 200 }'
```

Observe the decoder logs:

```
$ oc logs qwen-decoder
